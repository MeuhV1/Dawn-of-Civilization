		<English>[TAB]An igloo, translated sometimes as snowhouse, is a shelter constructed from blocks of snow, generally in the form of a dome. Although igloos are commonly associated with all Inuit, they were predominantly constructed by people of Canada's Central Arctic and Greenlands Thule area. There were three types of igloo, all of different sizes and were used for different purposes. The smallest of all igloos was constructed as a temporary shelter. Hunters while out on the land or sea ice camped in one of these iglooit for one or two nights. Next in size was the semi-permanent, intermediate sized family dwelling. This usually was a single room dwelling that housed one or two families.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The largest of the igloos was a temporary building constructed either by enlarging a smaller igloo or building from scratch. These could have up to five rooms and housed up to 20 people. A large igloo may have been constructed from several smaller igloos attached by their tunnels giving a common access to the outside. These were used to hold community feasts, traditional dances or Katajjaq.</English>
